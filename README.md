kgrid
=====

Generates a suitably converged **k**-point grid for solid-state
quantum chemical calculations.

Current status
--------------

* Reads specified input file using Atomic Simulation Environment ([supported formats](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/io.html#module-ase.io))
  * If none is specified, looks for geometry.in (FHI-aims) in working directory
* A **k**-point density is selected to satisfy a given length cutoff, as
  described by Moreno & Soler (1992)[1]. The length cutoff corresponds to the length between repeated images that would be needed in a supercell calculation to achieve the same sampling.
* This **k**-point grid is expressed as a number of samples in each
  lattice vector and passed to standard output
* Default **k**-point cutoff is 10Å (generally well-converged for
  semiconducting or insulating materials)
* Optional arguments are implemented with conventional GNU/POSIX
  syntax, including -h help option

Requirements
------------

* Developed with Python 2.7; not tested with other versions
* [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase) (ASE)
* [Numpy](www.numpy.org) (Also a requirement for ASE.)
